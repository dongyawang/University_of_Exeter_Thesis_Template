# Thesis Template: University of Exeter (unofficial)

This is a minimum working example of a template that adheres to the
[University guidelines](http://as.exeter.ac.uk/academic-policy-standards/tqa-manual/pgr/presentationoftheses/)
as of 24/09/2019. 

Note: the template does not use the *correct* font according to the guidelines (Size 12 in Arial)
as the general consensus is that using Arial is unprofessional - no issues were raised with the font change.

The template was the basis of my [PhD thesis](https://ore.exeter.ac.uk/repository/handle/10871/38781) 
and it was submitted with only minor alterations to it.
