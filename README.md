# University of Exeter PhD in Computer Science thesis template

This is a minimum working example of a template that adheres to the
[University guidelines](http://as.exeter.ac.uk/academic-policy-standards/tqa-manual/pgr/presentationoftheses/)
as of 24/09/2019. Note: the template does not use the *correct* font according to the guidelines (Size 12 in Arial)
as it looks highly unprofessional.

The template was the basis of my [PhD thesis](https://ore.exeter.ac.uk/repository/handle/10871/38781) 
and the thesis was submitted with only minor alterations to it.
